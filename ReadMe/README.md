PROJECT 1

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
I have built an interactive Jeopardy game that features sound effects and a point system. I created this app using html5, css, and vanilla javascript. There are a few portions that have jQuery  and bootstrap in it.

The app is a quiz game that consists of 15 squares. When a square is clicked a question will pop up and the user must input an answer. Depending on if the users answer is correct or incorrect, points will either be added or subtracted from the users point bank.
